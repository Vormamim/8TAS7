You have chosen the dense forest, it will be a longer journey to the dragon’s castle but you are safer this way.

You walk through the forest, feeling not a touch of sunlight from the scorching sky, protected by the busy leaves of the trees.

This place was completely desolated you think, besides the many insects biting at your limbs

You itch immediately at the thought

“Who seeks me?” a voice rumbles 

“Amber,” you reply.

“Amber, what brings you through this path?” the voice asks.

You frown, wary of who was behind the voice

“I want to reach the dragon’s castle”

Almost like clockwork, you were pulled up onto the branches of a tree, its leaves cradling you metres away from the ground.

You let out a scream as the branches flipped you upside down

In front of you was an old face of a woman, except it was on a tree

Tell me Amber, what do you seek with the dragon?

I seek to save a group of cats that the dragon has captured!

The tree did not reply, the bark of her face wrinkling as she stared at you

Travellers come to me in search of a hint, searching for treasure or what not

Her words were cool but stern

Listen closely to me, for I have a hint that is the most useful of them all

The code follows a sequence

Somehow your face feels cold in this scorching place

"Thank you," you stammer. unsure of what to do

"Be gone from here now!" she shouts into your entire body, "head on with your noble journey!"

You knew you hold onto your entire being

You had already beghan to scream as she tosses you from her branch over the tops of the trees

You fly over hundreds, the air forcing your eyes open

You whimper as your body hits the ground
