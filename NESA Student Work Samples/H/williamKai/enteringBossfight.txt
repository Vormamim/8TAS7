As you walk throught the doorframe into the next room, your face is cast in shadow by the silouette of a pillar. You look around the room and see that it's empty. The old, twisting spirals of vines creeping along the walls a stark contrast to the pillar in the centre, ominous and uninviting. As you walk towards the pillar, the doors close behind you and a robotic voice utters to you: place .. frag..nt ..to p..destal...

You enter a dark chamber. Ancient runes glow faintly on the walls, pulsing with an otherworldly energy. In the center stands a mysterious pedestal.
