You skip out of your home excitedly, the view of the river and forest felt closer with every skip.

“Help me!”

You jolt backwards, startled by the cat who has appeared out of nowhere.

“Help, my friends have been captured!”

The stranger is gripping onto you, sweating profusely with fear and worry. His fur is tangled and his paws are scratched, you feel 

You ask: “Who captured your friends?”

“The dragon! He’s taken them to his castle! He’s trying to capture all the cats!”

“Calm down sir! Tell me how it happened” you say.

“I was with my cats when we were consumed by flames! I couldn’t see anything but the land around me, but when I did the shadow of two giant wings loomed-”

He struggles to continue, shuddering at the memory, “my cats in the claws of the dragon”

The fear in the cat's face made you feel pitiful; the thought of the dragon sent a shiver down your spine. The dragon intrigued you. An evil dragon in a castle, that’s something you’ve never seen before
You decided this was an adventure you’d like to take. 

“I will save your friends!” you declared.

The cat snapped out of his hysteria, looking back at you with confusion, turning into horror soon enough.

“Why would you do that! The dragon will take you too!” he cried.

You ponder his question. Anything to get yourself out of the cottage. Dave and Lucy wouldn’t mind, and you’d be back soon enough.

“No-he-won’t,” you answered confidently, nodding between each word, “if you don’t mind now, I’m setting off to the dragon’s castle! You should prepare a feast, because by nightfall you’ll have all your cats back!”

You turned your back on the cat and eyed the possible paths you could take. Forest or river, forest or-

“Wait!” the cat cried out, “take this with you, it may be useful!”

He held out his paw and in it was a packet of levitation power.
