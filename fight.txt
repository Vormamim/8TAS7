You defeat the robot, its screws unravelling to reveal a corpse of wires and circuits. You gratefully take your bone and attach it to your torso. With the explosion of the robot, and as the dust settles, a pathway leading to an opening is revealed. You exit the cave to a quaint pond where you see a ghost sitting on a chair. That's... odd. You were the only monster here... You approach the ghost and he welcomes you to sit on the floor next to him. He doesn't seem to question you being there. 

'I haven't seen you around here? Are you the new guy living on the boat?'

'I didn't know other monsters were here...'

'What do you mean? Everyone here is a monster!'

'What? I thought I was the only one.'

'Nope. And I saw one of those delinquents with your bone earlier. I took it from them, you can take it.'

And with that, you are re-assembled.
